# HybridRL-FlightControl

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/iamlucassantos/thesis_pilot/HEAD)

This repository contains code for the flight controller developed as part of the thesis _"Robust, Responsive and Reliable control: Fault-tolerant flight control system using Hybrid Reinforcement Learning with DSAC and IDHP"_. The controller uses a hybrid reinforcement learning approach with two algorithms, Distributional Soft-Actor Critic (DSAC)[^1] and Incremental Dual Heuristic Programming (IDHP)[^2]. The objective is to develop an adaptive system that can track an aircraft's attitude even in adverse conditions, such as system failure and environment disturbances.

## Overview üõ©Ô∏è

Aircraft control systems are crucial for safety and must always keep the aircraft controllable, regardless of any environment or system disruptions. One way to improve flight safety and stability is through adaptive flight controllers, which can adjust their behaviour in response to changing circumstances. Reinforcement learning is a promising technique for designing these controllers.

The research aims to develop a cascaded flight controller that uses a hybrid offline and online learning approach to provide robustness and adaptiveness to aircraft control. The goal is to create a controller that can still function effectively under failure and adverse conditions.

## Setup Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

To run the code in this repository, you will need to create a Python environment as follows:

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. Run the application:
```
uv run hrl <args>
```

### Example: Running an experiment
```bash
uv run hrl run exp_sac_hyml.yaml
```

## Repository contents üìö

The repository contains the following:

- Code for the cascaded flight controller and reinforcement learning algorithms used in the research
- Data and results from simulations and experiments
- Thesis document (in PDF format)
- Presentation slides used for thesis defense
